                <h3 class="Activity-title">The Shrewsbury Prison Guided Tour</h3>
                <p class="Activity-description">Follow in the footsteps of ex-convicts during a tour of Shrewsbury Prison, home to over 200 years worth of history. You’ll explore the former jail with a prison office who once managed the wings, for the inside scoop on what used to occur
                    within the walls. You’ll hear tales about capital punishment and see the spots on which executions took place.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Activity Two -->

            <div class='Activity'>
                <img class='Activity-img' src="images/wrekin.jpg" alt="A picture of the View from the top of 'The Wrekin'">
                <h3 class="Activity-title">Hike the Wrekin</h3>
                <p class="Activity-description">The Wrekin is an iconic Shropshire hill located near Telford. The wooded ridge offers a challenging but manageable climb and beautiful natural surroundings. Very popular with walkers and fantastic views from the summit. Can get very busy,
                    especially at weekends.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Activity Three -->

            <div class='Activity'>
                <img class='Activity-img' src="images/the-quarry.jpg" alt="A picture of the Quarry park, Shrewsbury">
                <h3 class="Activity-title">Visit The Quarry</h3>
                <p class="Activity-description">The Quarry is perfect for many things... a quick walk, a longer stroll, admiring the river, jogging, taking your dog for a walk, watching people take their dogs for a walk, playing sports, sitting on the grass in the summer, having a picnic,
                    sitting on a bench, exploring the dingle, being alone, being with friends - you name it. </p>
